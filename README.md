# Landing page for a tech store
Tech Store Landing Page is a website that shows you all main information about an online store.

This is my third project in the Responsive Web Design course at FreeCodeCamp.

## Details

The website has a lot of different features:
* header with navigation links that take you to specific part of the site
* email subscription button
* description of the store
* embed youtube video
* stylized list of products

This landing page is also responsive on mobile devices.
